"""Cyberpunk TCG prompt templates: the SFT/inference message shape and the
rubric judge's system prompt.

`build_messages` is the SINGLE definition of this game's prompt shape, used
identically by SFT dataset assembly (`harness.core.sft.build`) and by
eval-time generation (`harness.core.eval.harness`) -- see
`games/base/game_interface.py`'s `GameConfig.build_messages` contract.
Changing this shape after training an adapter invalidates it; an adapter is
only valid for the prompt format it saw. Use `harness.core.prompt_fingerprint`
to stamp an adapter to its training-time prompt shape once this stabilizes.

"""Chunk the Cyberpunk TCG rules corpus and card database for retrieval.

Four outputs: rule chunks, card chunks, errata chunks, and all three
concatenated into `corpus_chunks.jsonl`, which is what the retrieval index is
actually built over.

ERRATA ARE CHUNKED, AND CARDS ARE ANNOTATED WITH THEM

Errata are the one part of this corpus that overrides another part: the
official page says the updated text "supersedes all printed text at all
levels of play". Retrieval can return a card chunk without the erratum that
corrects it, so the card's own chunk carries a line saying an erratum exists.
That line is the point -- a model reading only the card would otherwise have
no way to know its text had been superseded, and would answer confidently
from stale text.

WHY ONE MERGED INDEX IS ENOUGH HERE, AND WHEN IT STOPS BEING

The One Piece instance of this template cannot use a single index: its card
chunks outnumber its rule chunks 48:1 (2,767 to 58), so card text wins nearly
every slot in a fixed retrieval budget even on a pure rules question, and it
needs a dual-budget router to fix it. This game's launch set is 151 card
chunks against 74 rule chunks -- 2:1 -- so a plain top-k over one index still
returns a mix, and shipping a router now would mean shipping an untested
mechanism to solve a problem this corpus does not have.

That changes as sets ship. The two per-source files are written separately,
and stay written separately, precisely so a router can be added later without
re-shaping the corpus first: once cards outnumber rules by something like 10:1
-- roughly 750 cards, five or six sets -- re-measure retrieval on rules-only
questions before trusting the merged index further.

RULES CHUNKING

Rule nodes arrive from `scripts/ingest.py` already in document order, with a
`section` field naming the top-level section each belongs to. Chunking is a
greedy pack capped at `--max-chars`, flushed whenever the section changes, so
a chunk never straddles two top-level sections and the outline's locality
survives into retrieval.

Heading-only nodes (a `section` node carries an empty body) are packed along
with the rules beneath them rather than dropped: a chunk that opens with
"9.2 Declare Step" is substantially easier to retrieve for a question about
declaring an attack than one that opens mid-rule.

CARD CHUNKING

Cards are already atomic -- one card is one chunk. `card_to_text` reshapes a
parsed card record into the `{"chunk_id", "text"}` shape
`harness.core.rag.index` expects.
